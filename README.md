📝 Blog & Content
I regularly share my work on malware development, low-level system internals, and red teaming techniques through detailed write-ups, project documentation, and tool development logs.

Follow my journey in offensive security on:

	•🐦 Twitter — for real-time updates, insights, and write-ups
	•💻 GitHub — for open-source tools, PoCs, and project source code

Whether it’s building custom tooling, experimenting with evasion techniques, or documenting reverse engineering workflows, my goal is to share practical, real-world insights as I grow in the cybersecurity field.
